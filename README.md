# Topka
A very simple ball game built in Unity, using Javascript. The primary goal was to get more comfortable with Unity.

Brackeys' ![tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N49cfP-MWJA) on youtube were a huge help in getting started. I made all the models in Blender, except for the enemy model, which I found in Brackey's tutorial package. I used free online textures and sounds, and the music is my own.
